# FrontEnd Challenge - SuperSummary

This project was created with the purpose of demonstrating in a Technical Trial some of the FrontEnd
coding skills of Jo√£o Paulo de Sousa Brito (John), going through the hiring process for SuperSummary.

## To run this application

First and foremost, you must have Node.js installed in your system. This code already includes this user's
personal New York Time Book API key, but feel free to set up ypur own through [this website's](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) instructions.

Next, clone the [repository](https://github.com/jpsousa78/NYT-Bestsellers.git) you found this README in (or run this line in your terminal `git clone https://github.com/jpsousa78/NYT-Bestsellers.git`).

Once cloned, open your terminal and enter the repository folder through a command line. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies. Then, run `npm start` in your terminal. After that, a tab should pop up in your browser window in the addresss [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If not, you can also freely browse through this link.

And that's it! Feel free to explore the application!

Further below there are some standard documentation on the react app.


## Standard React App functionalities

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
